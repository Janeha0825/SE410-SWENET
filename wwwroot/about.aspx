						<h1>About SWEnet - The Network Community for Software Engineering Education</h1>
						<p><strong>SWENET</strong> - The Network Community for Software Engineering 
							Education - is a project to produce and organize high-quality materials 
							supporting software engineering education. As a first step in this process, a 
							framework will be developed which serves as a high-level taxonomy for the areas 
							of knowledge comprising software engineering. The framework will not be 
							developed ab initio, but rather will build on the work of the ABET program 
							criteria for software engineering education and the classification proposed by 
							the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) project sponsored by the 
							IEEE Computer Society and the Association for Computer Machinery. Four areas of 
							particular importance to undergraduate software engineering - design, quality, 
							requirements, and process - have been singled out as the most appropriate 
							starting points for developing curricular materials.</p>
						<p>Each of these areas will be further subdivided into modules, each encompassing 
							one to six lecture hours of material. These are not to be construed as 
							providing a canonical way of presenting software engineering concepts. Indeed, 
							this project will not define a particular curriculum model. A more modest (but 
							achievable) goal is to provide tested materials that can be adopted, modified, 
							and enhanced by engineering educators across the nation. The modules serve 
							simply to organize these materials - data sets, program samples, lab 
							activities, etc. - in a coherent fashion. The repository thus created will be a 
							dynamic, evolving clearinghouse to which all members of the software 
							engineering community can add new and improved materials.</p>
						<p>The repository will, first and foremost, aid those faculty members interested 
							in learning about software engineering and incorporating these principles in 
							their courses. In some cases this will lead to full baccalaureate programs in 
							software engineering; at the other end of the spectrum, basic concepts may form 
							threads that are woven through the computing courses of a different engineering 
							discipline. The non-prescriptive nature of the repository will both encourage 
							and support experimentation with the best way to teach software engineering in 
							each institution's specific context.</p>
						<p>A second effect will be the collection in one location of materials that have 
							been tried and tested in classrooms and laboratories. The relative immaturity 
							of software engineering means that such materials, which are common in more 
							established disciplines, are difficult to acquire. The synergy created by 
							encouraging both the use and contribution of material will help alleviate this 
							problem.</p>
						<p>It is also expected that these materials will find use other than in standard 
							academic programs. Industrial training courses can be built from these 
							resources, thus addressing the common situation where junior engineers are 
							involved in software-intensive projects for which their education is 
							insufficient. High school teachers can use the repository to build software 
							engineering into traditional science and technology courses. Finally, the 
							results of using the repository will shed light on the adequacy of the initial 
							framework, leading to improved versions of documents such as those from SWEBOK.</p>
						<p>The project will require three years, with each year primarily devoted to one 
							particular aspect. In the first year, the focus will be on the design of the 
							framework architecture, the creation of a web site (or sites) modeled on this 
							framework, and the definition and development of modules and materials in the 
							four areas of emphasis. The second year will see the incorporation of these 
							materials in new or existing courses at the project institutions, and the 
							subsequent assessment of student performance and evaluation of the materials 
							themselves. Based on this information, the materials will be refined, and in 
							the third year they will be introduced in a select few volunteer institutions 
							outside the original group. In addition, the third year will be devoted to 
							dissemination and publicity. The project plan calls for a series of 
							publications, tutorials, and workshops to inform engineering educators about 
							SWENET, and to entice them to acquire, adopt, and adapt the materials. This in 
							turn will fuel the effort to expand and improve SWENET indefinitely.</p>
